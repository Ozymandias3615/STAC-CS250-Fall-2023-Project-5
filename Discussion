The code that I wrote and ChatGPT wrote are quite similar with the use of unordered maps 
to store the data that is read from the text file. Where our codes start to differ are when
it comes to reading the files in, our variable names, and how we group our files. ChatGPT likes
to code everything into one file but we divide the header files and the cpp files. Admittedly I
took some inspiration of the use of exceptions to catch run-time errors from ChatGPT as I didn't
know what I was doing in that instance.
